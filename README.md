# :white_check_mark: ft_irc (project 2020-2021)
  
This test project is intended for a deeper study of the operation of sockets and their interactions on the example of an IRC chat/server.  
The test project is built via a Makefile and is run using two commands:  
`./ircserv [port] [pass]` if you need to start a single network  
`./ircserv [ip:port:pass] [port] [pass]` if you need to join an existing network

IRC (Internet Relay Chat) - an application-level Protocol for exchanging messages in real-time.  
Designed primarily for group communication, it also allows you to communicate via private messages and exchange data, including files.  
IRC uses the TCP transport protocol and cryptographic TLS (optional).  
IRC began to gain particular popularity after Operation "Desert Storm" (1991), when messages from all over the world were collected in one place and broadcast on-line to IRC  
Due to the technical simplicity of implementation, the IRC protocol was used in the organization of botnets as a means of transmitting control commands to the computers participating in the botnet from the owner.  
### :earth_americas: IRC network
According to the protocol specifications, an IRC network is a group of servers connected to each other. The simplest network is a single server.  
The network should have the form of a connected tree, in which each server is the central node for the rest of the network.  
A client is anything that is connected to the server, except for other servers. There are two types of customers:  
- custom settings;  
- service stations.  
  
### üìÑ Run server
When you run the `make server` command, it compiles and runs on port 1080  
Our server implementation supports the following commands:  
* admin 
* away 
* connect 
* error
* info
* invite
* join
* kick
* kill
* links
* list
* lusers
* mode
* motd
* names
* nick
* notice
* oper
* part
* pass
* ping
* pong
* privmsg
* quit
* server
* squit
* stats
* time
* topic
* trace
* user
* version
* wallops
* who
* whois
  
### üìÑ Run client
Also as a bonus we implemented the client part written in the qt framework.  
To interact with the bot, use a command like `PRIVMSG pogoda <City>`  
If you use a third-party chat, such as xchat, then use a command like `/pogoda <City>`
